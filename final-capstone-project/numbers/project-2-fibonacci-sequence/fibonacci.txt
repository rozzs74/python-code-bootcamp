A.History
His real name was Leonardo Pisano Bogollo, and he lived between 1170 and 1250 in Italy.
"Fibonacci" was his nickname, which roughly means "Son of Bonacci".
Fibonacci Day is November 23rd, as it has the digits "1, 1, 2, 3" which is part of the sequence. So next Nov 23 let everyone know!

B.The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
    The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1)
    The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
    And the 5 is (2+3),
    and so on!

The Fibonacci Sequence can be written as a "Rule" (see Sequences and Series).
First, the terms are numbered from 0 onwards like this:
n = 	0 	1 	2 	3 	4 	5 	6 	7 	8 	9 	10 	11 	12 	13 	14 	...
xn = 	0 	1 	1 	2 	3 	5 	8 	13 	21 	34 	55 	89 	144 	233 	377 	...

So term number 6 is called x6 (which equals 8).

So we can write the rule:

The Rule is xn = xn-1 + xn-2

where:

    xn is term number "n"
    xn-1 is the previous term (n-1)
    xn-2 is the term before that (n-2)

Example: term 9 is calculated like this:
x9= x9-1 + x9-2
 = x8 + x7
 = 21 + 13
 = 34
