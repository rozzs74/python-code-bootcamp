--> Tuples are very similar to lists. However they one key difference - "Immutability"
--> Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned
--> Tuples use parenthes (1,2,3)
Common built in functions for Tuples
count(<tuple_item>) - return how many count of the item inside tuple
index(<tuple_item>) - return the index position value from tuple    

tuple unpacking in for loop
mylists = [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8)]
for (a,b) in mylists:
    print(a)
    print(b)
