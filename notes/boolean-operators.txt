The three Boolean operators are "and, or, not"
Boolean operators read from left to right execution
The truth table
(and truth table) one condition is false its already false
T T = T
F T = F
T F = F
F F = F

(or truth table) either one of the condition is true its really true
T T = T
F T = T
T F = T
F F = F

(not truth table) basically not ask for the opposite boolean
not T = F
not F = T

boolean operators are use on logical operator such chaining comparison operator
